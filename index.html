          <h3>Data Science, Structures, Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code when I was 14 years old. But It was until High-School that I knew I wanted to study it deeply. I started out with Python and manage to get a job as a Data Science
           intern. I learned a lot about the mananging of data, and how to store it in databases. More recently I´ve been learning a lot of C++ in order for the deep understanding of data structures and
           algorithms. Lastly I´ve gain confidence in app development and just started with web development with the hope that in a future I could be a Full-Stack developer. </p>

          <h3>Playing the piano</h3>
          <p>This is one of my first earned skills. I've played the piano since I was four years old, and never quited. Every year I get to play at piano recitals in front of a crowd of approxtimately 80 people.
          My goal is to one day create my own Sonata like Bethooven or Mozart.  </p>
